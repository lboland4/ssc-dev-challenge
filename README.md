Created for SingleStone Front-End Dev Challenge

I used create-react-app to bootstrap this project.
No additional libraries other than those included in create-react-app were used to create this web app.

Note: There aren't 2 contributors like GitHub would lead you to believe. I didn't switch github credentials from an old account over to this one. Oops!!

To run:
### `npm install`
Get all of our dependencies.


### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
